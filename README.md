## Privacy Policy
###### PreDiagnose ApS.
###### Privacy Policy
###### Version 1.02
###### Last Modified: 16/02/2021
 
*PreDiagnose Online* is PreDiagnose’s internet-based software application, which provides access to your personal account and enables you to conduct measurements using our device and sensors and provide you with automatic readings upon measurements. We produce and sell a variety of diagnostic products that consist of disposable sensors operated by our free app *PreDiagnose Online*, and a hardware device. Currently, all products are For Research/Investigational Use Only. Not for use in Diagnostic Procedures.
### Definitions
- Service
	* Service is the mobile application and its associated server side functionality operated by PreDiagnose
- Personal Data
	* Personal Data means data about an individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession).
- Usage Data
	* Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself.
- Data Controller
	* Data Controller means the natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information are, or are to be, processed. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your Personal Data.
- Data Processors (Service Providers or Third Party)
	* Data Processor (or Service Provider or Third Party) means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. We may use the services of various Service Providers in order to process your data more effectively.
- Data Subject (or User)
	* Data Subject is any individual who is using our Service and is the subject of Personal Data.
 
 


### User Consent
By using our Application, you are consenting to our processing of your Personal Data, Usage Data, De-identified Data, and Anonymous Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. Processing means using data collected on a computer/hand held device or using or touching information in any way, including but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the European Union.
 
#### Types of Data We Collect
Each chip that we provide for our hardware, belongs to a set: a box of chips that we sell for a specific measurement, and we have a variety of such boxes. Each chip has a QR code on it that was generated at the production time of the chip. The QR code contains a sequential UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that is stored on our server as part of a blob (a data file) containing all the UUIDs for all the chips for the current box. This is to ensure that 
1. The chips are not counterfeit,
2. The right chip is used for the right measurement (and also for example the box of chips might come with its own bottle of suspension liquid calibrated for and attributed to those chips only), 
3. How many chips there are left in the box you’ve bought (to warn you based on how many you need for a test and if you’re running out), 
4. To know what type of test needs to be run on the data that comes from this chip once the data reaches our servers. 

These UUIDs are database IDs for the required service functionality, and do not have any identifiable user data associated with them. The app can be used by essentially anyone with an email address but it is not associated to any UUIDs, as users and multiple apps can share boxes (and also the used emails do not have to be a patient's or a doctor's email). We have no way of knowing who is using what chip or to whom the chips ended up. After a box of chip UUIDs gets used up, it gets deleted from the server.

### User Registration
For logging in, PreDiagnose Online uses Auth0 https://auth0.com/privacy, with servers located in the EU, to obtain a session token that is valid for our app and our servers. We use this to establish a secure session, and to prevent spam use of our services. The Auth0 login is done via an existing Google or Microsoft account or other social accounts chosen by the user, or via a direct email address (with emailed one-time passwords) - and there is no actual "user registration"; the login scheme can be thought of as "passwordless" or "registrationless" authentication. There is also no connection between an Auth0 database and our own code / services; the only things we receive on our side from Auth0 is the fact that the current user successfully authenticated for this session using a valid PreDiagnose Online app, their email address, and a temporary session token id. This information including the email address, is only available while the app is running (and logged in), and never leaves the user's device without their active and explicit request. There is no identifier ever generated from the email address and neither such an ID nor the email itself are stored or sent anywhere by us in any way. We use the email address purely to display to the user that they are the ones currently using the app, and to send support tickets in the event that they choose to run a PreDiagnose hardware device diagnostic check.

#### Use of Your Personal Data
General Use. In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. In all cases any and all personal data we receive will have been submitted to us directly and actively and willingly by the user. Data taken is never sold nor shared with 3rd parties or used for advertising purposes. Ways we use your Personal Data include, but are not limited to: (1) to facilitate the creation of new orders; (2) to create a measuring session; (3) to improve the quality of experience when you use our Applications; (4) to send you a welcome email with access code. 

#### Third Party Data Collection – Service Providers
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

##### Third party services
The PreDiagnose Online mobile app is built using the Xamarin.forms Android .NET environment. The app requires the app's Camera permission in order for the app to scan QR codes from the products that we sell. This is to identify the type of test the user is doing and to guide the user through the usage of e.g. the different number of test chips in our test boxes. Any wireless communication or "location" permissions required by the app are just for the use of the Bluetooth function to connect the device to our sample-measuring hardware, or to check if the device is online and send test data to the server to process.

For logging in, PreDiagnose Online uses Auth0 https://auth0.com/ as mentioned in the User Registration section.

PreDiagnose Online's server side processing uses a “serverless” stateless enterprise server environment (Microsoft and/or Amazon), with servers located in the EU, which we employ to run our server side code as stateless functions for the processing of test data and computing diagnosis.

##### Analytics
We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.
We may use in-app analytics but only temporary upon express request from the user to submit an error report, or user feedback, or a device calibration result. This data may contain the current logged in user's email address and the current sensor chip UUID and even the result of the diagnosis. Submitting these kinds of reports is voluntary and as we have mentioned in the "Types of Data We Collect" section, an email does not necessarily need to represent the patient nor the doctor, researcher, or organization.

The app store package-level analytics and statistics on the deployent, usage, or crash reports of our app on the Google Play store are standard and subject to the privacy practices of Google. Please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en

##### Payments
We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we will use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).

We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.

The payment processors we may work with are:
- Apple Store In-App Payments
	- Their Privacy Policy can be viewed at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/
- Google Play In-App Payments
	- Their Privacy Policy can be viewed at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
- Stripe
	- Their Privacy Policy can be viewed at https://stripe.com/us/privacy
- PayPal / Braintree
	- Their Privacy Policy can be viewed at https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full
 
###### Links to Other Sites
Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.
 
#### Data Retention Policy
On your Android device, the data that comes from our custom hardware, is cached in temporary internal local data files, before it gets sent to the server for processing. On the server it arrives as a blob file, and once the server function is run on it, the blob is deleted from the server. The local cached file might remain on the local device however, e.g. if the type of test requires a “Baseline measurement” or “blank measurement” to be done and stored for use with the next defined amount of tests you perform from this box of chips. The cached file(s) will be removed at the latest when the box of tests is finished (or when the app is uninstalled). No emails or UUIDs or user identifiable data is stored in these files.

PreDiagnose does not keep a copy of the final results / diagnosis output and it is the customer's responsibility to keep a copy of the final output.
