### The purpose of processing of personal data 
Personal data is collected and processed when using the Application either automatically generated by the use of the Application or by your submission of personal data to the Application. 

The automatically generated data (within the Application) relates to personal data that is not covered by article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation or section 11(2) of the Danish Data Protection Act.

We process your personal data for the following purposes:
-	To respond to requests that you make, 
-	To facilitate the creation of new orders,
-	To create a measuring session, 
-	To aid us in serving you better and to improve the quality of experience when you use the Application, and 
-	To send you a welcome email with an access code. 


#### The legal basis for processing of personal data
The legal basis for our processing of personal data are based on the following clauses in the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”):

•	Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR
•	Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR
•	Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR

If processing of personal data is on the legal basis of either article 6(1)(a), i.e. your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal will not affect the legality of the processing carried out prior to the withdrawal of consent.

Processing of personal data on the legal basis of article 6(1)(f), is first and foremost based on our legitimate interests in ensuring network and information security, including preventing unauthorized access to the electronic communication network (the Application), malicious code distribution, stopping “denial of service-attacks” and damage to the electronic communication system (the Application). Secondly and in connection with the above, processing is based on our legitimate interest in ensuring the Application’s functionality and flowless operation and the possibility in offering a satisfactory service. 


#### Recipients of personal data
As a rule, only PreDiagnose’s trusted employees may process your personal data for the purposes listed above.

If PreDiagnose however discloses or otherwise transfers personal data to a third party, e.g. a service provider for the purposes listed above, PreDiagnose ensures that such disclosure or transfer is lawful at all times. 


##### Transfer of personal data to countries or international organizations outside the EU/EEA ("Third Countries")
To the extent that the processing of personal data may involve a transfer to third countries, e.g. by using a hosting provider located in a non-EU/EEA country, PreDiagnose ensures that such transfer is lawful at all times, including that the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation for the establishment of an adequate level of protection for the transfer are met.

##### Storage of personal data
Personal data is stored for as long as necessary for the fulfilment of the purpose for which it is collected and processed, unless there are circumstances in favor of longer storage, for example an ongoing lawsuit or prospect.

##### Rights of data subjects
Besides from the right to withdraw any consent given, the GDPR also provides you with the following rights: 

Right of access by the data subject – article 15: 
•	You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the information listed in article 15, e.g. purpose of the processing, the recipients, etc. 

Right to rectification – article 16:
•	You have the right to request rectification of inaccurate personal data without undue delay and in specific cases, to have incomplete data completed.

Right to erasure – article 17:
•	You have the right to obtain from us the erasure of your personal data without undue delay, and we have an obligation to erase your personal data on one of the grounds listed in article 17.

Right to restriction of processing – article 18:
•	You have the right to obtain from us restriction of processing of your personal data when one on the grounds in article 18 applies. 

Right to data portability – article 20:
•	You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another data controller without hindrance from us. If requested and technical possible, we may also transmit the data to another data controller.

Right to object – article 21:
•	You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on the legal basis of article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (i.e. our legitimate interests). 

The abovementioned articles may include limitations or conditions associated with these rights, and the right to exercise your rights thus depends on the specific circumstances of the specific processing activities, e.g. it will not be possible to have personal data deleted, if deletion would conflict with PreDiagnose’ obligations under applicable law.

As a data subject, you can raise questions about your rights or exercise these by contacting us. Please find the contact information above.

A complaint can also be lodged with the Danish Data Protection Agency, Carl Jacobsens Vej 35, 2500 Valby.
