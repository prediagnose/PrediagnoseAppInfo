# PrediagnoseAppInfo
Privacy policy for the PreDiagnose Online app.

Our application and services are created to aid medical research and diagnosing, and these software services are distributed for free but are only usable via our custom diagnosing hardware.

What information do we collect?
---
- We developed our services in a stateless manner and aim to not collect any identifiable information.
- We require the app's Camera permission in order for the app to scan QR codes from the products that we sell. This is to identify the type of test the user is doing and to guide the user through the usage of e.g. the different number of test chips in our test box. Once a product (or group or box of products) is used, all the data is discarded from the app and the servers. 
- Any wireless communication or "location" permissions required by the app are just for the use of the Bluetooth function to connect the device to our sample-measuring hardware, or to check if the device is online.
- Our services never collect or store any user login credentials, emails, or any such private information, and cannot associate any identifiable information with e.g. the QR codes the different users scan.
- We require an email address or google account in order to sign the user into the app, for security reasons and to compartmentalize the workflow in case multiple people use the same app. This login is handled by auth0.com and is translated into a unique unidentifiable random session id that we do not store, we only check if it is valid.
- The custom sensor hardware we provide collects measurements from the sample the user provides. This data is sent to the server to process the requested analysis and return results. The data is processed in a stateless way and discarded after the results are delivered back. Temporary files may be stored but no identifiable information is stored in them or associated to them.

How do we use the information?
---
- We use the information to secure the app's session to the servers, and conduct analysis on the data provided from the user's sample to our paired custom diagnosis hardware. The services we provide are designed in a stateless way.
- Any data that might be stored is not linked to any user's identity and only resides on our servers during the time it takes to process the data, for the express purpose of processing the data from the samples introduced into our products to serve the requested analysis result to the user.


What information do we share?
---
- We don't share any information with any 3rd parties, and the purpose of our services is to be a stateless processor of data through our custom hardware that we sell. Our purpose is not to collect (or share) data.
